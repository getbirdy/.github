## Hi there üëã

üôã‚Äç Welcome to Birdy, the next generation of open-source CMS systems for the web. Birdy is built using our favorite tech stack, [Tall Stack](https://tallstack.dev/). We are currently still in pre-release development, so it isn't adviced to use the product as of yet, however feel free to follow, star and contrubute to our roadmap. 

üåà Want to help out in the development of Birdy? Feel free to check out our main repository where you can find the latest releases and development work, and if you think their is something to imrpove on, or you have a feature that you would like to see in the CMS, feel free to submit an Issue or PR and we are more than happy to discuss.

## :egg: Eggs
Eggs are plugins for Birdy and can be found inside the orginisation. Some plugins are 1st party plugins that are created by the team here at Birdy, some are 3rd party, created by the amazing community of developers and can be found on their own source control. We have an official marketplace for plugins that anyone can add their plugins too, simply make a PR on the [Eggs](https://github.com/getbirdy/eggs) repository and within 24 hours your plugin will be published onto the Eggs marketplace. After your plugin is published, it will be available to any website using Birdy, however it will also enter a verification state, where we will verify the usage of the plugin and once it has become verified, it will recieve the verified badge. Plugins without verification can be used by uploading the plugin to your Birdy dashboard, however it is not recommended as these plugins could be malicious and attempting to do harm. 

- If you want to create a plugin, please refer to the eggs wiki for requirements and naming convensions. 
- Eggs can be hosted on your own GitHub, however once it has been verified, you hearby give us the write to submodule your repository into our system to allow for updates on our dashboard. If you do not want this, please do not submit your plugin to our marketplace and simply provide downloads to users who want to use your plugin. 

## :feather: Feathers
Feathers are themes for Birdy and can be enabled from insided your Birdy dashboard. You can find some amazing templates written with [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) inside your dashboard, however you are able to create custom templates inside your Birdy website easily. As above with eggs, developers can make themes and put them onto our marketplace using the same method as above, if you want to know more, please refer to our documentation about creating and publishing themes.
